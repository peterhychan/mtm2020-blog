Are you ready for **Master the Mainframe 2020**?

We need the additional configurations to begin with our journey of Master the Mainframe 2020.

## Why would we need the following configurations?

Because we need additional toolkits to ensure our communications between our clients (i.e. our laptop) and the IBM Mainframe as smooth/enjoyable as possible.

In this article, I'll list the basic setups necessary to start MtM2020:

```md
- [] Visual Studio Code  
- [] Node.js (version 14 or above)
- [] IBM Z Open Editor for VSCode
- [] Zowe Editor for VSCode
- [] Docker
- [] Eager to learn
```

## Are you ready ?
