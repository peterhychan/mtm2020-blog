As the old saying goes, a good start is halfway to success. I hope you have enjoyed the experience of finishing level one of Master the Mainframe 2020. Level One is not too difficult, but you get everything necessary to complete the entire Master the Mainframe 2020 challenge. In this article, I recap some keynotes in Level One for your reference. 

There are ***_FOUR_*** challenges for level One. 

* **1.1 PDP**: You will learn what a mainframe is
* **1.2 VSC**: You will set up your laptop for MtM2020. Make sure you have installed NodeJS, Visual Studio Code on your laptop. You should already install IBM Z Open Editor and Zowe Explorer via the VSC marketplace. Please save your userId and password given for accessing the z/OS mainframe.
* **1.3 RTL**: You will connect to the z/OS mainframe using VSC. You should be able to list all datasets under your userId
* **1.4 Congrats**: You have completed level One! Don't forget to claim your completion certificate.


I hope you find these keynotes useful. Hope to see you soon. Keep Hacking!
